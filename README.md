Final Project from CIS1057

This project is a Bank Reconciliation Program, which is the final project for CIS 1057 for Spring 
2016.

The program prompts the user to select 1 of 10 options for the program to perform for the user, with
the 0 value serving as the sentinel value for the program. Otherwise, the program loops and awaits the
input for the user.

This project also includes both the accounts.txt and the transactions.txt, in which the program uses
and writes to both .txt files upon reading and writing transactions. Those files essentially play the
role of a database.
